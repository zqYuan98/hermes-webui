"""
Hermes Web UI -- Optional state.db sync bridge.

Mirrors WebUI session metadata (token usage, title, model) into the
hermes-agent state.db so that /insights, session lists, and cost
tracking include WebUI activity.

This is opt-in via the 'sync_to_insights' setting (default: off).
All operations are wrapped in try/except -- if state.db is unavailable,
locked, or the schema doesn't match, the WebUI continues normally.

The bridge uses absolute token counts (not deltas) because the WebUI
Session object already accumulates totals across turns. This avoids
any double-counting risk.

    When ``profile`` is provided the function resolves *that* profile's

    function returns ``None`` rather than silently falling back to
    ``HERMES_HOME`` — silently routing the write to the wrong DB
    would defeat the point of the explicit-profile path (#2762).

    When ``profile`` is None it falls back to the TLS-based
    ``get_active_hermes_home()`` lookup for backward compatibility,
    with a final ``HERMES_HOME`` fallback only on that path. TLS may be
    unset in background/worker threads, in which case the lookup falls

    wrong DB. Callers that know the session's profile (e.g.
    ``sync_session_usage`` after a stream completes on a background
    thread) should pass it explicitly to avoid that race.

    Returns None if hermes_state is not importable, the explicit
    profile cannot be resolved, or the DB is unavailable. Each caller
