    """Atomically replace *path* with *text*.

    Writes to a temp file in the same directory, flushes + ``os.fsync``, then
    ``os.replace``s it into place, so a crash (or exception) mid-write can never
    truncate an existing file — the old contents stay intact until the rename
    commits the new ones in one step.  Mirrors the tempfile+fsync+os.replace
    pattern already used for ``.env`` and cost snapshots in ``api.providers``;
    extracted here so ``config.yaml`` / profile ``config.yaml`` writers can share
    it without pulling in env-file-specific logic.

    Permissions and ownership are preserved: ``os.replace`` carries the temp
    file's metadata onto the target, and ``tempfile.mkstemp`` starts with the
    writer's owner/group and mode ``0600``. Without correcting those values,
    every rewrite could silently reset a shared config's group and tighten a
    group/other-readable ``config.yaml`` (commonly ``0644``/``0664``) down to
    owner-only. Existing files copy uid/gid and mode onto the temp descriptor;
    new files use the active process umask, exactly as a normal
    ``open(..., "w")`` would.
    (Unlike ``.env``, ``config.yaml`` holds no secrets and is not meant to be
    forced to ``0600``.)

    Symlinks and hard links keep the same follow-through semantics as
    ``Path.write_text``: writing ``config.yaml`` through a symlink updates the
    referent, while writing an inode with multiple hard links updates every
    alias rather than severing the selected path. A symlink target change
    observed before commit is rejected rather than updating a stale referent.

    The temp+rename dance needs WRITE PERMISSION ON THE DIRECTORY, which the
    plain ``Path.write_text`` it replaced did not: hardened deployments
    (``HERMES_CONFIG_PATH`` pointing into a root-owned, read-only dir with a
    writable ``config.yaml`` inside) would otherwise lose the ability to save
    settings at all. When temp creation is denied, or the original uid/gid
    cannot be transferred to the temp inode, we fall back to a guarded
    descriptor write only if the target is still the regular-file inode
    inspected above. Hard-linked files and files with extended attributes use
    that same path because replacing their directory entry would respectively
    break ``Path.write_text`` compatibility or discard metadata such as POSIX
    ACLs. These in-place writes are serialized across process-local WebUI
    writers. They give up crash-atomicity (and raw concurrent readers may
    observe the write in progress) only where atomic replace with preserved
    semantics is impossible. Other ``PermissionError``s still propagate.
    Successful renames fsync the parent directory where supported.

    The caller is responsible for ensuring ``path.parent`` exists.
