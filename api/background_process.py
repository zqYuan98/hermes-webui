"""Drain thread for terminal(notify_on_complete=true) agent wakeup.

The hermes-agent ``tools.process_registry.ProcessRegistry`` exposes a thread-safe
``completion_queue`` (a ``queue.Queue``) that any background process pushes onto
when it exits or matches a ``watch_patterns`` rule. In the CLI and in the
gateway adapter this queue is drained by the host's main loop; in WebUI the
queue was never read, so the agent never woke up from a ``notify_on_complete``
finish. This module restores that behavior.

The drain thread:
    1. blocks on ``completion_queue.get()`` in a worker thread,
    2. looks up the WebUI session_id from ``PROCESS_SESSION_INDEX`` (keyed on
       the per-process ``session_key`` env var captured at spawn time),
    3. formats a synthetic ``[IMPORTANT: ...]`` wakeup prompt, identical in
       intent to ``cli._format_process_notification`` and
       ``gateway.run._format_gateway_process_notification`` so the agent sees
       the same payload regardless of host,
    4. emits a canonical ``bg_task_complete`` SSE event (plus a temporary
       ``process_complete`` alias for the migration window) on the active
       stream(s) for that session (DEMOTED to pure live-view — an open tab
       streams the turn live), records a server-side marker in
       ``PENDING_BG_TASK_COMPLETIONS``,
       and — Option Z PIVOT — starts the agent wakeup turn **directly
       server-side** when the session is idle (``_start_server_side_wakeup_turn``
       → ``routes.start_session_turn``). This needs NO browser round-trip, so
       the closed-tab case works exactly like CLI / Telegram / gateway
       self-wake. When a turn is already active the wakeup is NOT started here;
       the ``PENDING_BG_TASK_COMPLETIONS`` marker is left for PR #2279's
       next-turn drain (``api/streaming._drain_webui_process_notifications``).

The marker is *not* required for delivery — it's a telemetry-style flag the
turn handler can read to know "this stream is a process_complete wakeup, not a
human-typed prompt". It also lets the PR #2279 next-turn drain deliver the
wakeup when a turn was active at completion time; the marker drains harmlessly
on the next turn for the session.

Watch-pattern events share the same queue but produce a different SSE payload;
this module routes them to the same listener so the frontend's single
``process_complete`` handler can re-POST either flavor verbatim.

    ``ch = get_or_create_session_channel(sid); q = ch.subscribe()`` released
    ``SESSION_CHANNELS_LOCK`` between the two steps. The reaper acquires that

# dedupe a process_id against a SINGLE shared key inside the agent's
# ``tools.process_registry.ProcessRegistry``:
#
#   * READ  side: the PUBLIC ``is_completion_consumed(process_id)`` method
#     (used in ``_process_one`` above) — stable public API.
#   * WRITE side: there is NO public ``mark_completion_consumed`` upstream, so
#     B must reach into the registry's private ``_completion_consumed`` set
#     (guarded by its private ``_lock``) to set the shared marker A reads.
#
# That private WRITE coupling is what Copilot review #2242 comment #4 flagged.
# The long-term fix is an upstream PUBLIC ``mark_completion_consumed`` — see
# the test ``test_registry_completion_consumed_contract`` which fails CI LOUD
# the moment ``_completion_consumed`` / ``_lock`` / ``is_completion_consumed``
# is renamed or retyped upstream, instead of a future rename silently
# reintroducing the double-wakeup bug. ``_mark_registry_completion_consumed``
# narrows the exception handling so a rename is logged at ERROR (visible in
# errors.log + monitoring) rather than swallowed by a broad ``except`` at
# DEBUG. ImportError stays best-effort (the registry is legitimately absent in
# non-agent unit-test contexts; this module's own locked
# ``BG_TASK_COMPLETE_EVENTS_SEEN`` gate still dedupes B's own duplicates there).

# WebUI-only change. So this resolver is forward-compatible by DUCK-TYPING:
# if a future core grows an env-immune spawn-owner attribute (any of the

    Runs on a short-lived daemon thread so the drain loop NEVER blocks:
    ``start_session_turn`` itself spawns the agent worker thread, but does
    synchronous session-load / workspace / model resolution first, which must
    not stall the single drain thread shared by every WebUI session.

    Concurrency + idempotency are enforced by the layers below, not here:
      - ``start_session_turn`` → ``_start_chat_stream_for_session`` serializes
        on the per-session agent lock and returns ``_status=409`` if a turn is
        already active. A human ``/api/chat/start`` racing this wakeup wins
        (one starts, the other 409s). On 409 we re-queue the prompt via
        ``record_deferred_wakeup`` (see below) so the racing turn's own
        teardown idle-hook — or PR #2279's next-turn drain — redelivers it.
      - ``BG_TASK_COMPLETE_EVENTS_SEEN`` already deduped this process_id in
        ``_process_one`` before we were called, so a process wakes at most once.

    Why re-queue on 409 instead of trusting the PENDING marker: this helper is
    called from two sites. The idle branch of ``_process_one`` leaves the
    PENDING_BG_TASK_COMPLETIONS marker intact, but the teardown-hook caller
    ``drain_deferred_wakeups_for_session`` has ALREADY atomically claimed the
    deferred entry and discarded the marker before spawning this thread. So in
    the teardown path a 409 would otherwise lose the wakeup permanently —
    nothing is left to drain. Re-queuing here is uniformly correct: it is
    idempotent per ``process_id`` (``record_deferred_wakeup`` dedupes) and the
    claim in ``claim_deferred_wakeups`` is atomic, so re-queue can never cause
