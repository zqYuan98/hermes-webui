# Hermes Web UI: Browser Testing Plan

> This document is for manual browser testing by you or by a Claude browser agent.
> It covers user-facing features of the UI across current releases.
> Each section is written as a step-by-step test procedure with expected outcomes.
> A browser agent (e.g. Claude with Chrome access) can execute this plan directly.
>
> Prerequisites: SSH tunnel is active on port 8787. Open http://localhost:8787 in browser.
> Server health check: curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health should return {"status":"ok"}.
>
> Automated coverage: ~11,500 tests collected via `./scripts/test.sh tests/ --collect-only -q`. Tests run on every PR via GitHub Actions on Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 (3 parallel shards each), alongside a ruff lint gate, a headless browser smoke test, and a Docker smoke test. The suite covers the bootstrap/static wizard, real provider config persistence (`config.yaml` + `.env`), the `/api/onboarding/*` backend, the onboarding skip/existing-config guard, CSS regression coverage for thinking/tool card animation, streaming session persistence, mobile layout breakpoints, locale parity across 14 languages, and hundreds of issue/PR-pinned regression tests.
> Run: `./scripts/test.sh`
>
> Local regression focus: verify that a previously closed workspace panel stays visually closed from first paint through boot completion on desktop refresh; there should be no brief open-then-close flash.

## Static JS runtime lint (brick-class regression guard)

Some JS bugs throw a `TypeError`/`ReferenceError` only when a specific function
actually runs in the browser — `node --check` (lazy syntax check), source-presence
tests, and even executing the file all miss them. Issue **#3162** was exactly this:
a `const` binding reassigned inside `_ensureMessagesLoaded` bricked "load conversation
messages" on every mobile message (v0.51.161–166).

The guard is a curated, zero-false-positive ESLint config (`eslint.runtime-guard.config.mjs`)
that runs ONLY runtime-error rules (`no-const-assign`, `no-import-assign`) over
`static/**/*.js` and `extensions/**/*.js`. It is NOT a style linter and has no formatting rules.

```bash
# one-time dev setup (ESLint is a dev-only tool; the app stays pure Python + vanilla JS):
npm install --no-save --before=<a-date-≥48h-ago> eslint   # package-age guard
# run the guard:
npm run lint:runtime
# or directly:
npx eslint --no-config-lookup -c eslint.runtime-guard.config.mjs "static/**/*.js" "extensions/**/*.js"
```

## Python lint gate (ruff) — forward-looking, new-code-only

The Python twin of the ESLint runtime guard. A curated `ruff` ruleset
(`[tool.ruff]` in `pyproject.toml`) catches latent-bug shapes — unused imports
(F401), undefined/unused names (F841/F821), redefinitions (F811), mutable default
args (B006), raise-without-from (B904), loop-variable capture in closures (B023) —
**plus** real syntax/runtime errors (E9). It is **not** a style/formatting linter:
the pure-style families (line-length, whitespace) are intentionally OFF so the gate
never demands a reformat of existing code.

The existing tree carries a cosmetic backlog (mostly unused-import F401) that is
deliberately **not** reformatted. So the gate is enforced **only on the lines a
change adds or modifies** (`scripts/ruff_lint.py --diff`), which keeps new code
clean without touching the backlog. Cleaning the backlog is a separate,
maintainer-run, safe-fixes-only decision (tracked in #3273).

```bash
# one-time dev setup (ruff is a dev-only tool):
pip install ruff            # or: uv tool install ruff / uvx ruff ...
# the gate (only flags violations on lines you added/changed vs origin/master):
python3 scripts/ruff_lint.py --diff origin/master
# whole-tree backlog report (informational — never blocks):
python3 scripts/ruff_lint.py --all
```

`tests/test_ruff_forward_lint.py` holds the **whole tree** free of E9 (real
syntax/runtime) findings and verifies the curated config shape; it runs in-suite
when ruff is present and **skips gracefully** when it isn't — so environments
without ruff aren't blocked, while CI (which installs ruff) enforces it. The
diff-scoped gate runs as the `lint` job in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` and is
also part of the maintainer pre-release pre-gate.

## Automated browser smoke (runtime brick-class gate)

The ESLint guard above catches `const`-reassign / import-assign statically. The
**browser smoke** catches the same brick class *dynamically* — plus anything else
that throws only when a real browser executes the page (e.g. a `function X(){}` /
`window.X = {}` name collision like #2715/#2771, which ESLint can't see).

`tests/browser_smoke.py` boots the real `server.py` (agent-free, on an ephemeral
port, with an isolated temp state dir) and loads the key pages in headless
Chromium, failing if **any** console error or uncaught JS exception fires on load.
It runs in CI (`.github/workflows/browser-smoke.yml`) on every PR and push to
master, and locally:

```bash
pip install playwright && python -m playwright install chromium
python tests/browser_smoke.py
```

It is intentionally **credential-free**: it strips every `*_API_KEY` from the
environment before launching the server, needs no secrets, and does not drive a
real model (it verifies the app *loads and initializes* cleanly — the brick class
that breaks the page for everyone).

## Public conversation lifecycle gate

`tests/browser_conversation_lifecycle.py` adds a public deterministic
multi-row lifecycle gate. It drives the real composer and real WebUI server in Chromium,
while a localhost-only fixture supplies reasoning, tool, process, and final/error
events through the existing Hermes Gateway Runs API. The gate now covers both
normal and terminal-error proof-matrix rows, asserting semantic activity during
live streaming, after settlement, and after hard reload, including
transcript-backed `activity_scene_v1` persistence and zero unexpected browser
errors. It uses isolated temporary state and no provider credentials.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt playwright
python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Normal-path deterministic conversation lifecycle gate.
python tests/browser_conversation_lifecycle.py

# Terminal-error lifecycle gate (new row in the proof matrix).
LIFECYCLE_SCENARIO=terminal-error python tests/browser_conversation_lifecycle.py
```

To certify that the gate catches its target failure, the test owns an opt-in
mutation that drops the browser's Anchor-scene persistence request. This command
must fail at the hard-reload boundary:

```bash
LIFECYCLE_TEST_BITE=drop-anchor-persistence \
  python tests/browser_conversation_lifecycle.py

# Terminal-state-specific mutation bite: remove terminal row from persisted scene
# so hard reload cannot recover terminal status.
LIFECYCLE_SCENARIO=terminal-error \
LIFECYCLE_TEST_BITE=drop-terminal-anchor-row \
  python tests/browser_conversation_lifecycle.py
```

The dedicated `Conversation lifecycle (informational)` workflow runs both current
proof rows (`normal` and `terminal-error`) and stays non-blocking while the public
matrix expands to additional behavior rows. The maintainer's private QA harness
remains broader; later public slices will add session switching, reconnect/replay,
cancellation, compression, and recovery.


`tests/test_static_js_runtime_lint.py` runs this automatically when eslint is present
and **skips gracefully** (clear message) when it isn't — so environments without the
node toolchain aren't blocked, while the release gate (which installs eslint) enforces it.

To widen the guard, fix the pre-existing intentional hits first (as of 2026-05-30:
`no-dupe-keys` ×92 i18n locale-fallback, `no-func-assign` ×2 panel override,
`no-redeclare` ×1) then promote the rule into the config.

STEPS:
  1. Change model dropdown to "Claude Sonnet 4.6"
EXPECT:
  - The composer footer dropdown stays on "Claude Sonnet 4.6"
  - Sending the next message uses that session model rather than an older one from another conversation
STEPS (continued):
  2. Change model to "Gemini 2.5 Pro"
EXPECT:
  - The dropdown updates to "Gemini 2.5 Pro"

## Automated Test Coverage Reference

These behaviors are verified by pytest (run: ./scripts/test.sh tests/ -v):

Sprint 1 tests (test_sprint1.py):
  - Server health, session CRUD (create/load/update/delete/sort)
  - B11 footgun fix (/api/session 400 on missing ID)
  - Multipart parser: text file, binary PNG
  - HTTP upload: success, too large, no file field, bad session
  - Approval API: pending, inject+deny, inject+session-approve
  - Stream status endpoint
  - File listing, path traversal block

Sprint 2 tests (test_sprint2.py):
  - GET /api/file/raw: PNG, JPEG, SVG content-types
  - GET /api/file/raw: path traversal blocked, missing file 404
  - GET /api/file: markdown content returned as text
  - GET /api/file: markdown with table content preserved
  - GET /api/list: image and markdown files appear in directory listing

Manual-only tests (not covered by automation):
  - All browser rendering tests (T5.5, T5.6, T5.7 -- visual verification)
  - T7.1-T7.3 -- tool approval card (requires live agent execution)
  - T9.1 -- reconnect banner timing
  - T10.1 -- concurrent session switching
  - T11.1, T11.2 -- responsive layout
  - T11.3 -- log output verification
  - All visual/CSS checks

## Claude Browser Agent Instructions

If you are a Claude agent with browser access, follow these instructions:

1. Navigate to http://localhost:8787 (assumes SSH tunnel is active from your Mac).
2. Execute tests in order. For each test:
   a. Follow SETUP instructions.
   b. Perform each STEP using browser tools (click, type, navigate).
   c. Use browser_vision or browser_snapshot to verify EXPECT conditions.
   d. Record PASS or FAIL with a brief note on what you observed.
3. For tests requiring file uploads: use the browser's file picker; you may need to
   create test files in /tmp first via terminal.
4. For T7.x (approval tests): the agent running inside Hermes needs to detect a
   dangerous command. Ask Hermes to "run: rm -rf /tmp/test_hermes_approval" and watch
   for the card. The actual rm will not run in a safe test workspace.
5. Skip T9.1 (reconnect banner) unless you can precisely time a page reload during an
   active SSE stream.
6. Report results as a checklist at the end.

## Sections Added Post-Sprint 10 (Sprints 11-19)

The following features were added in Sprints 11-19 and need manual browser testing.
Each has automated API-level tests in `tests/test_sprint{N}.py`.

### Sprint 11: Multi-Provider Models
- Open model dropdown. Verify models grouped by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)
- If custom `base_url` configured in config.yaml, verify local models appear in dropdown.
- Switch model. Send a message. Verify response uses selected model.

### Sprint 12: Settings + Pin + Import
- Click the "Hermes WebUI" button in the sidebar footer. Control Center overlay opens with vertical section tabs on the left.
- Change default model, save. Restart server. Verify setting persisted.
- Pin a session (star icon in hover overlay). Verify it floats to top of list.
- Export session as JSON. Import it back. Verify messages restored.

### Sprint 13: Alerts + Session QoL
- Duplicate a session (copy icon in hover overlay). Verify "(copy)" title.
- Browser tab title updates to active session name. Switch sessions — title changes.

### Sprint 14: Visual Polish + Workspace Ops
- Create a mermaid code block in a response. Verify diagram renders inline.
- Message timestamps visible next to role labels (hover for full date).
- Double-click a file in workspace panel to rename. Enter saves, Escape cancels.
- Create a folder via folder icon in workspace header.
- Add `#tag` to session title. Verify tag chip appears in sidebar. Click to filter.
- Archive a session. Verify it disappears. Toggle "Show archived" to see it.

### Sprint 15: Session Projects
- Click "+" in project bar to create a project. Type name, Enter.
- Click a project chip to filter sessions.
- Hover a session → click folder icon → assign to project via picker.
- Verify colored left border appears on assigned session.
- Double-click project chip to rename. Right-click to delete.
- Code blocks have a "Copy" button. Click → "Copied!" feedback.
- Messages with 2+ tool cards show "Expand all / Collapse all" toggle.

### Sprint 16: Sidebar Visual Polish
- Session titles use full sidebar width (no truncated space for hidden icons).
- Hover a session → a dotted actions trigger appears on the right.
- Click the dotted trigger → a dropdown opens with pin, project, archive, duplicate, and delete actions.
- All icons are monochrome SVGs (not emoji). Consistent across platforms.
- Pinned sessions show small gold star inline. Unpinned = no star, full title width.
- Active session has gold highlight (not blue).
- Double-click to rename → session actions hide during rename.

### Sprint 17: Workspace + Slash Commands + Send Key
- Navigate into a subdirectory. Breadcrumb bar appears with clickable segments.
- Up button in panel header navigates to parent. Hidden at root.
- Type `/` in composer → autocomplete dropdown appears. Arrow keys navigate.
- Type `/help` → lists all commands. `/clear` clears conversation. `/model` switches.
- Settings panel: change send key to Ctrl+Enter. Verify Enter inserts newline.

### Sprint 18: Thinking + Tree View + Preview Fix
- View a file in workspace. Click a breadcrumb or folder → preview closes automatically.
- Click a directory toggle arrow (▸) → expands in-place showing children.
- Click again (▾) → collapses. Double-click navigates into it (breadcrumb view).
- If model returns thinking blocks (Claude extended thinking), verify collapsible gold card appears above response.
- Verify the thinking card has a tinted background, visible border, and rounded corners like a tool card, but in the gold thinking palette.
- Open and close a thinking card. Verify the caret rotation and the content reveal both animate smoothly instead of snapping open.

### UI Polish: Tool Card Disclosure Animation
- Trigger a response with at least one completed tool call card.
- Open and close the tool call card. Verify the caret rotates smoothly and the args/result section animates open and closed instead of appearing instantly.
- If a turn has 2+ tool cards, use "Expand all / Collapse all" and verify the same smooth animation applies to every card in the group.

### Sprint 19: Auth + Security
- No password set: everything works as normal. No login page.
- Set `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD=test` env var. Restart. All pages redirect to `/login`.
- Login page: minimal card, password field, "Sign in" button.
- Enter correct password → redirected to `/`. Cookie set (24h).
- Enter wrong password → error message, stay on login page.
- Settings panel: set password via "Access Password" field. Auth activates.
- "Sign Out" button visible when auth active. Click → redirected to /login.
- API calls without auth cookie → 401 JSON response.
- Check response headers: `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`.

### Sprint 20: Voice Input + Send Button
- Mic button visible in composer (Chrome/Edge). Hidden in Firefox.

- Sidebar top nav remains visible inside the mobile drawer; includes Chat/Tasks/Skills/Memory/Spaces/Profile tabs.
- Tap "Tasks" in the drawer nav → Tasks panel opens in the sidebar drawer.
- Tap "Chat" in the drawer nav → sidebar closes and chat is unobstructed in the main area.
- Files button in topbar → right panel slides in from right.
- No fixed mobile bottom nav; chat transcript and composer use the reclaimed vertical space.
- All touch targets are at least 44px (session items, buttons, icons).
- Desktop viewport (>640px): no hamburger or mobile overlay; desktop layout unchanged.
- Docker: `docker compose up -d` starts server on port 8787.
- Docker: session data persists across container restarts (named volume).

### Sprint 22: Multi-Profile Support

- Profiles panel: cards with name, model, provider, skill count, API key status.
- "Use" button switches profile. Delete button removes non-default profiles.
- "+ New profile" form: name validation (lowercase + hyphens), clone config checkbox.
- Create profile → appears in list and dropdown.
- Delete profile → confirmation modal. Auto-switches to default if deleting active.
- Attempt switch while agent busy → blocked with toast message.
- With hermes-agent not installed → only default profile shown, graceful fallback.

## Slash command parity (manual checklist)

For each batch-1 command, run via webui slash menu AND via `hermes` CLI in the
same `HERMES_HOME` (when applicable) and verify identical effect.

- [ ] `/help` — dropdown lists 25+ commands; selecting `/help` posts an assistant message listing them.
- [ ] `/new` (and alias `/reset`) — starts fresh session.
- [ ] `/clear` — clears current transcript display (webui-only meaning, distinct from CLI's "clear screen").
- [ ] `/title <name>` — renames active session, topbar + sidebar update; `/title` alone shows current title.
- [ ] `/status` — assistant message shows session_id, model, workspace, message count.
- [ ] `/usage` — assistant message shows token counts; the "show token usage" setting is unchanged (toggle still in Settings panel).
- [ ] `/stop` — interrupts a running stream; with no active stream toasts "No active task to stop."
- [ ] `/retry` — removes last user+assistant exchange, refills composer with last user text, resends. Final transcript has only ONE copy of the resent message.
- [ ] `/undo` — removes last user+assistant exchange; toast confirms; repeated until empty toasts "Nothing to undo."
- [ ] `/model <name>` — switches model dropdown.
- [ ] `/personality` — lists personalities; `/personality <name>` switches.
- [ ] `/skills [query]` — lists matching skills.
- [ ] `/theme <name>` — switches webui theme.
- [ ] `/workspace <name>` — switches workspace.

Unknown / deferred:

- [ ] `/yolo`, `/reasoning`, `/voice`, `/branch`, `/insights`, `/debug`, `/reload`, etc. — toast "Web UI 暂未实现该命令: /<name>". MUST NOT be sent as plain text to the LLM.
- [ ] `/compact` — toast "/compress is not available in the web UI yet — use the CLI for now." (was sending free text to LLM before this batch.)
- [ ] Made-up command (e.g. `/fhfajl`) — fall through to send as text (existing behavior preserved for typos vs. real commands).

Bridged CLI sessions:

- [ ] Open a CLI-bridged session in webui sidebar (if `show_cli_sessions` setting enabled).
- [ ] `/retry`, `/undo` toast "该命令仅支持 Web UI 原生会话…" and do nothing.
