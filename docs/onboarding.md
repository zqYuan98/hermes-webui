# First-run onboarding guide

This guide explains what happens the first time Hermes WebUI starts, which
setup path to choose, and how to recover when the wizard cannot finish.

If an AI assistant is helping with install, reinstall, bootstrap, provider
setup, or first-run support, read
[`docs/onboarding-agent-checklist.md`](onboarding-agent-checklist.md) before
running commands or inspecting logs.

The short version: run the bootstrap, open the WebUI, choose a provider, choose
a workspace, optionally set a password, then start a chat. If you are using a
local model server from Docker, pay special attention to the Base URL section
below.

## Before you start

Hermes WebUI is only the browser interface. The actual agent runtime, memory,
skills, config, cron jobs, and provider credentials belong to Hermes Agent.

The bootstrap supports Linux, macOS, and WSL2. Native Windows is not supported
by the bootstrap yet. A community native Windows setup is being tracked in
[#1952](https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui/issues/1952), including:

- [Native Windows guide](https://github.com/markwang2658/hermes-windows-native-guide)
- [Native Windows setup scripts](https://github.com/markwang2658/hermes-windows-native)

For Windows users who want the supported path today, use WSL2 and see
[Windows / WSL auto-start](wsl-autostart.md).

## Install path choices

| Path | Use it when | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local bootstrap | You run WebUI directly on Linux, macOS, or WSL2 | Best for a personal server, Mac mini, VPS, or homelab host. |
| Docker single-container | You want the simplest container setup | Recommended first Docker path. WebUI runs the agent in-process. |
| Docker two-container | You already run the agent gateway separately | More isolated, but tools launched from WebUI run in the WebUI container. |
| Docker three-container | You want agent gateway plus dashboard plus WebUI | Same caveats as two-container, plus the dashboard service. |
| Native Windows community path | You are intentionally testing unsupported native Windows | Community-maintained for now, not the official bootstrap path. |

If a Docker install gets confusing, start again with the single-container setup.
It avoids most UID/GID, source-volume, and tool-location surprises. See
[Docker setup guide](docker.md) for the full container reference.

## Re-running onboarding safely

Do not delete `~/.hermes` just to see the wizard again. That directory can hold
your real Hermes config, credentials, memory, skills, profiles, sessions, and
cron state.

For a clean local trial, use an isolated Hermes home and WebUI state directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/hermes-onboarding-test
HERMES_HOME=~/hermes-onboarding-test/.hermes \
HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR=~/hermes-onboarding-test/webui \
HERMES_WEBUI_PORT=8789 \
python3 bootstrap.py
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8789`.

For an assistant-led trial run, follow the safety rules, evidence commands, and
pass/fail criteria in
[`docs/onboarding-agent-checklist.md`](onboarding-agent-checklist.md).

If your repo has a `.env` file, remember that the bootstrap loads it. Remove or
adjust any `HERMES_HOME`, `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR`, or `HERMES_WEBUI_PORT`
entries there before using the isolated command above.

For managed hosting or fully preconfigured images, set
`HERMES_WEBUI_SKIP_ONBOARDING=1` to bypass the wizard.

## What the wizard checks

The first screen reports the runtime state WebUI can see:

- Hermes Agent importability: whether WebUI can import and run `AIAgent`.
- Provider status: whether `config.yaml` and credential state are enough for a
  chat request.
- Password status: whether WebUI password protection is enabled.
- Config paths: the active `config.yaml` and `.env` locations for this profile.

If the agent check fails, use [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md), especially
the `AIAgent not available` section. If provider setup is incomplete, continue
through the wizard or run `hermes model` in the same machine environment that
will run WebUI.

## Choosing a provider

The setup step groups providers by how much information they usually need.

| Group | Examples | What you usually enter |
|---|---|---|
| Easy start | OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI | API key and model. |
| Open / self-hosted | Ollama, LM Studio, custom OpenAI-compatible, AIML API | Base URL, model, optional API key. |
| Specialized | Gemini, DeepSeek, Xiaomi MiMo, Z.AI / GLM, NVIDIA NIM, Mistral, xAI | Provider API key and default model. |

For API-key providers, the wizard writes the key to the active Hermes `.env`
file and writes the default model/provider to `config.yaml`. Those two files are
committed as one profile-scoped transaction: a failed write restores both files
instead of reporting a partially applied setup as successful. The wizard accepts
only provider IDs in its displayed catalog; unknown or terminal-only provider
aliases are rejected rather than silently completing onboarding.

For local providers, the API key field can be blank when the server is keyless.
Most LM Studio, Ollama, vLLM, llama-server, and TabbyAPI installs run this way.
Use **Test connection** to verify the Base URL and populate the model list
before continuing.

AIML API uses the existing custom OpenAI-compatible setup path, not a
first-class built-in Hermes provider id. Configure it under the
custom-provider flow with Base URL `https://api.aimlapi.com/v1`, then use
either the normal custom-provider API key field or a config entry that points
at `AIMLAPI_API_KEY` if you want the custom provider to read its key from the
environment. Create or manage keys at `https://aimlapi.com/app/keys`. Model
discovery comes from the live `/v1/models` response for that endpoint, not from
a static WebUI-maintained model list.

Advanced provider flows such as Nous Portal and GitHub Copilot are still
terminal-first. OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude Code OAuth can be started in
the onboarding flow when your Hermes config selects the corresponding provider.
If the wizard points you back to `hermes model`, use that CLI flow first, then
refresh WebUI.

## Base URL rules for local model servers

For self-hosted providers, the Base URL should point to the OpenAI-compatible
API root. Common examples:

| Server | Typical Base URL |
|---|---|
| LM Studio on the same non-Docker host | `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1` |
| Ollama on the same non-Docker host | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| LM Studio from Docker Desktop | `http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1` |
| Ollama from Docker Desktop | `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` |
| Local server from Linux Docker Engine | `http://api.local:<port>/v1` with `api.local:host-gateway` in Compose `extra_hosts` |
| Local server on another LAN machine | `http://<lan-ip>:<port>/v1` |

Inside Docker, `localhost` means the WebUI container itself, not your Mac,
Windows host, Linux host, or another machine on your LAN. If LM Studio or Ollama
is running outside the container, use `host.docker.internal` on Docker Desktop,
use the server's LAN IP address, or add a Linux Docker host alias:

```yaml
services:
  hermes-webui:
    extra_hosts:
      - "api.local:host-gateway"
```

Then use `http://api.local:<port>/v1` as the Base URL. The alias avoids writing
`localhost` in WebUI config where it would resolve to the container loopback
instead of the host service.

The wizard probes `<base-url>/models` before saving. A successful probe fills
the model dropdown. A failed probe blocks the setup step and shows an inline
error such as DNS failure, connection refused, timeout, HTTP error, or
unexpected response shape.

## Workspace step

The workspace is the filesystem location Hermes should use for new sessions.
It can be a source checkout, a project directory, or a general workspace folder.

In Docker, the default browsable path is `/workspace`, which maps to the host
directory mounted by the compose file. If the workspace appears empty, check the
Docker UID/GID and mount guidance in [Docker setup guide](docker.md).

## Password step

Password protection is optional for localhost-only installs. Enable it if you
expose WebUI outside `127.0.0.1`, behind a reverse proxy, or on a LAN.

For installed PWAs, prefer WebUI's built-in password over proxy basic auth. Reverse proxies are supported, but HTTP basic-auth challenges in front of the WebUI origin can interrupt the service-worker and shell-asset fetches the installed app relies on during updates. If you keep proxy auth, scope it so same-origin `sw.js`, manifest, and shell update requests can complete.

The password is stored through the normal WebUI settings path and hashed
server-side. You can change it later from Settings.

## What gets written

The wizard uses the same files and APIs as the normal app:

- Active Hermes `config.yaml`: provider, default model, and Base URL when
  relevant.
- Active Hermes `.env`: provider API keys when you entered one.
- WebUI `settings.json`: onboarding completion, workspace, password state, and
  other WebUI preferences.

State normally lives outside the repository. By default:

- Hermes Agent state: Windows `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes`; POSIX `~/.hermes`
- WebUI state: `$HERMES_HOME/webui` (Windows default `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes\webui`, POSIX default `~/.hermes/webui`)

Override these with `HERMES_HOME` and `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` when you need an
isolated test install.

## When to file an issue

File an issue when the diagnostics point to WebUI rather than local
configuration. Include:

1. Install path: local bootstrap, Docker single-container, Docker
   two-container, Docker three-container, WSL2, or community native Windows.
2. Output from `/health`, or the startup banner if the server never starts.
3. The provider selected in onboarding and the Base URL shape, with secrets
   redacted.
4. For Docker provider problems, the result of probing from inside the
   container, for example:

```bash
docker exec hermes-webui sh -c 'curl -sS -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1/models | head -50'
```

5. Any inline wizard error text and relevant logs.

Never paste API keys, OAuth tokens, or full `.env` contents into an issue.
