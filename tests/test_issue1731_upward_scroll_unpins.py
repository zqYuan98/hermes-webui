"""Regression tests for #1731: small upward scrolls during streaming.

The pre-fix scroll listener applied hysteresis symmetrically: an upward
scroll that landed inside the 250px near-bottom zone still reported
``nearBottom = true``, so ``_nearBottomCount`` kept incrementing and
``_scrollPinned`` stayed true. The next streaming token then snapped
the user back to the bottom. The user effectively had to escape the
250px zone in a single fling to get unpinned.

The fix tracks ``_lastScrollTop`` and unpins immediately when the user
explicitly scrolls upward, bypassing the hysteresis counter for the
unpin path while preserving it for the re-pin path (which is what the
#1360 macOS momentum protection actually needs).
