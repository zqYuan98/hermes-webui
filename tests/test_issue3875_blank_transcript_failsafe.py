"""Regression coverage for #3875 — chat transcript renders as only date separators.

#3875 (BUG: messages stopped displaying correctly): the chat transcript rendered as
nothing but a stack of date-change separators (SUNDAY / SATURDAY / dates) with no
message bodies between them. Two users confirmed it; only a restart appeared to help
(it didn't — it was a render-state bug, not server state).

Root cause: the live-to-final / Worklog redesign (#3401, v0.51.294) folds intermediate
assistant segments into a collapsed Worklog card and hides the source segment via the
``assistant-segment-worklog-source`` class (``display:none``). That is correct WHEN the
turn also has a visible final answer. But when a turn's ONLY content is folded into a
collapsed Worklog — e.g. an autonomous/interrupted run whose final assistant message is
empty, or a reload where ``S.toolCalls`` did not hydrate so the Worklog card has no
expandable tool steps — every segment is hidden and the turn paints as nothing, leaving
the transcript a bare stack of date separators.

The fix is a defensive fail-safe at the END of ``renderMessages``: a settled assistant
turn must never render with ZERO visible content. When a turn has no visible segment,
its folded Worklog group is expanded (or, as a last resort, its hidden worklog-source
segments are un-hidden) so the content is never silently swallowed. The fail-safe never
touches a turn that already has any visible segment, so the intended collapsed-Worklog
UX is preserved whenever a visible answer exists.

These are static source-structure assertions over the shipped ``renderMessages`` so the
invariant cannot silently regress.
